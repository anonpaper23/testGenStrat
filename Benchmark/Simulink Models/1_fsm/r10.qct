#10.    The sensor shall change states from NOMINAL to FAULT when limits are exceeded.

# UPDATED: 
# 1) Replacing {all} with specific timesteps. Requirement is not explicit
# about which timesteps to use. These are based on the model.
# 2) Typo in original referenced STATE rather than SENSTATE.

(FiniteStateMachine.SENSTATE{t-1}==0 and limits) impl (FiniteStateMachine.SENSTATE{t}==2);
